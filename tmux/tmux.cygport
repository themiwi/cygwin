# number of commits since the last stable version (to have a monotonically
# increasing version number). I.e. the output of "git describe".

RELEASE="1"
CATEGORY="Utils"
SUMMARY="Terminal multiplexer"
DESCRIPTION="tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and
controlled from a single terminal like screen. tmux runs as a server-client
system. A server is created automatically when necessary and holds a number of
sessions, each of which may have a number of windows linked to it. Any number
of clients may connect to a session, or the server may be controlled by issuing
commands with tmux. Communication takes place through a socket, by default
placed in /tmp. Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key binding,
or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key layouts."
